Next Topic: UAI Network Attachment Customization
UAI macvlans Network Attachments UAIs need to be able to reach compute nodes across the HPE Cray EX internal networks. When the compute node networks are structured as multiple subnets, this requires routing from the UAIs to those subnets. The default route in a UAI goes to the public network through the Customer Access Network (CAN) so that will not work for reaching compute nodes.</description>

User Access Service (UAS) The User Access Service (UAS) is a service that manages User Access Instances (UAIs) which are containerized services under Kubernetes that provide application developers and users with a lightweight login environment in which to create and run user applications. UAIs run on non-compute nodes (NCN), specifically Kubernetes Worker nodes.
At a high level, there are two ways to configure UAS with respect to allowing users access to UAIs.</description>

Volumes Volumes provide a way to connect UAIs to external data, whether they be Kubernetes managed objects, external file systems or files, host node files and directories, or remote networked data to be used within the UAI.
The following are examples of how volumes are commonly used by UAIs:
 To connect UAIs to configuration files like /etc/localtime maintained by the host node To connect End-User UAIs to Slurm or PBS Professional Workload Manager configuration shared through Kubernetes To connect End-User UAIs to Programming Environment libraries and tools hosted on the UAI host nodes To connect End-User UAIs to Lustre or other external storage for user data To connect Broker UAIs to a directory service (see Configure a Broker UAI Class) or SSH configuration (see Customize the Broker UAI Image) needed to authenticate and redirect user sessions  Any kind of volume recognized by the Kubernetes installation can be installed as a volume within UAS.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot UAIs with Administrative Access Sometimes there is no better way to figure out a problem with a UAI than to get inside it and look around as an administrator. This is done using kubectl exec to start a shell inside the running container as root (in the container). With this an administrator can diagnose problems, make changes to the running UAI, and find solutions. It is important to remember that any change made inside a UAI is transitory.</description>

When a UAI is created using a UAI Class, it is configured to use exactly what that UAI Class has in it at the time the UAI was created. UIA Classes permit Broker UAIs to create different kinds of UAIs based on the UAI Creation Class setting of the Broker UAI.</description>

Next Topic: UAI macvlans Network Attachments
UAI Host Node Selection When selecting UAI host nodes, it is a good idea to take into account the amount of combined load users and system services will bring to those nodes. UAIs run by default at a lower priority than system services on worker nodes which means that, if the combined load exceeds the capacity of the nodes, Kubernetes will eject UAIs and/or refuse to schedule them to protect system services.</description>

UAI Host Nodes UAIs run as Kubernetes pods on Kubernetes worker nodes. UAS provides a a mechanism using Kubernetes labels to prevent UAIs from running on a specific worker nodes, but any Kubernetes node that is not labeled to prevent UAIs from running on it is considered eligible to host UAIs. The administrator of a given site may control the set of UAI host nodes by labeling Kubernetes worker nodes appropriately.</description>

Troubleshoot Stale Brokered UAIs When a Broker UAI terminates and restarts, the SSH key used to forward SSH sessions to End-User UAIs changes (this is a known problem) and subsequent Broker UAIs are unable to forward sessions to End-User UAIs. The symptom of this is that a user logging into a Broker UAI will receive a password prompt from the End-User UAI and be unable to log in even if providing the correct password.</description>

It is possible that this is just a matter of starting the UAI taking longer than normal, perhaps as it pulls in a new UAI image from a registry.

Resource Specifications Kubernetes uses resource limits and resource requests, to manage the system resources available to pods. Because UAIs run as pods under Kubernetes, UAS takes advantage of Kubernetes to manage the system resources available to UAIs.
In the UAS configuration, resource specifications contain that configuration. A UAI that is assigned a resource specification will use that instead of the default resource limits or requests on the Kubernetes namespace containing the UAI.</description>

The first shows how an administrator can manually delete arbitrary UAIs or delete UAIs belonging to a given user or created using a given UAI Class. The second shows how an authorized user on can delete UAIs created in the legacy UIA creation mode.
When a UAI is deleted, any running WLM sessions associated with the owner of the UAI are left intact and can be interacted with through future UAIs owned by the same user or from UANs.</description>
