      <description>Stage 1 - Kubernetes Upgrade from 1.19.9 to 1.20.11  NOTE: During the CSM-0.9 install the LiveCD containing the initial install files for this system should have been unmounted from the master node when rebooting into the Kubernetes cluster. The scripts run in this section will also attempt to unmount/eject it if found to ensure the USB stick does not get erased.
 Stage 1.1 For each master node in the cluster (exclude ncn-m001), again follow the steps:</description>

      <description>Stage 2 - Ceph image upgrade For each storage node in the cluster, start by following the steps:
ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.2/scripts/upgrade/ncn-upgrade-ceph-nodes.sh ncn-s001 NOTE: Run the script once each for all storage nodes. Follow output of the script carefully. The script will pause for manual interaction. NOTE: These steps should be performed on one storage node at a time.
After the last storage node has been rebooted you will need to deploy node-exporter and alertmanager.</description>
