      <description>Stage 4 - Upgrade Aruba switches to 10.08.1021 As part of the CSM 1.2 upgrade, you must upgrade Aruba switches to 10.08.1021.
With that new software level, the NAE script to address Mac learning issue with 8325 switches is no longer required and needs to be deleted from the system.
4.1 Removal of NAE script Prerequisites  The nae_remove.py script relies on the /etc/hosts file to pull the IP addresses of the switches.</description>
