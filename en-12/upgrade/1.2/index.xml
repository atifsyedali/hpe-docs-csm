      <description>CSM 1.1 to 1.2 Upgrade Process Introduction This document is intended to guide an administrator through the upgrade process going from Cray Systems Management v1.1 to v1.2. When upgrading a system, this top-level README.md file should be followed top to bottom, and the content on this top level page is meant to be terse. See the additional files in the various directories under the resource_material directory for additional reference material in support of the process/scripts mentioned explicitly on this page.</description>
