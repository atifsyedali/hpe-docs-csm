ncn-m001# /usr/share/doc/csm/upgrade/1.0/scripts/upgrade/ncn-upgrade-ceph-initial.sh ncn-s001  NOTE: Run the script once each for all storage nodes. Follow output of the script carefully. The script will pause for manual interaction
 Stage 1.2 IMPORTANT: We scale down the conman deployments during stage 1.2 (this stage), so all console sessions will be down for this portion of the upgrade
IMPORTANT If this has be run previously, then check point files may need to be deleted.</description>

The scripts run in this section will also attempt to unmount/eject it if found to ensure the USB stick does not get erased.
 Stage 3.1 For each master node in the cluster (exclude ncn-m001), again follow the steps:</description>
