      <description>CSM 1.0.10 to 1.0.11 Upgrade Process Introduction This document is intended to guide an administrator through the upgrade process going from Cray Systems Management v1.0.10 to v1.0.11. When upgrading a system, this top-level README.md file should be followed top to bottom.
Terminology Throughout the guide the terms &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; are used in the context of the management nodes (NCNs). The &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; NCN is the master NCN from which all of these commands will be run and therefore cannot have its power state affected.</description>

      <description>Stage 0 - Prerequisites and Preflight Checks  NOTE: CSM-1.0.1 or later is required in order to upgrade to CSM-1.0.11.
 The following command can be used to check the CSM version on the system:
ncn# kubectl get cm -n services cray-product-catalog -o json | jq -r &amp;#39;.data.csm&amp;#39; This check will also be conducted in the &amp;lsquo;prerequisites.sh&amp;rsquo; script listed below and will fail if the system is not running CSM-1.0.1 or CSM-1.</description>

      <description>Stage 2 - Kubernetes Node Image Upgrade  NOTE: During the CSM-1.0.1 install the LiveCD containing the initial install files for this system should have been unmounted from the master node when rebooting into the Kubernetes cluster. The scripts run in this section will also attempt to unmount/eject it if found to ensure the USB stick does not get erased.
