# Manual Step 1: Interfaces

> Set up variables for lan0 configuration

```bash
pit:~ # site_ip=172.30.XXX.YYY/20
pit:~ # site_gw=172.30.48.1
pit:~ # site_dns=172.30.84.40
pit:~ # site_nic=p1p2
```

- `site_nic` The interface that is directly attached to the site network on ncn-m001.  This should not be lan0.
- `site_ip` The IP address and netmask in CIDR notation that is assigned to the site connection on ncn-m001.  NOTE:  This is NOT just the network, but also the IP address.
- `site_gw` The gateway address for the site network.  This will be used to set up the default gateway route on ncn-m001.
- `site_dns` ONE of the site DNS servers.   The script does not currently handle setting more than one IP address here.

## Setup the Site-link

External, direct access.

```bash
pit:~ # /root/bin/csi-setup-lan0.sh $site_ip $site_gw $site_dns $site_nic
```

# Log in now with SSH

Assuming you had the correct IP information generated by `csi`, the node should have booted with networking enabled.

## Setup the bond and vlan interfaces

### Copy the CSI generated ifcfg files into place

> Note we are not copying in the ifcfg-lan0 file at this time

```bash
pit:~ # system_name=barney
pit:~ # cp /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${system_name}/cpt-files/ifcfg-bond0 /etc/sysconfig/network
pit:~ # cp /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${system_name}/cpt-files/if*-vlan* /etc/sysconfig/network
```

### Bring up these interfaces

```bash
pit:~ # wicked ifup bond0
pit:~ # wicked ifup vlan002
pit:~ # wicked ifup vlan004
pit:~ # wicked ifup vlan007
```

## Manual Check 1 :: STOP :: Validate the LiveCD platform.

Check that IPs are set for each interface:

```bash
pit:~ # csi pit validate --network
```

# Manual Step 2: Services

Copy the config files generated earlier by `csi config init` into /etc/dnsmasq.d and /etc/conman.conf.
```bash
cp /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${system_name}/dnsmasq.d/* /etc/dnsmasq.d
cp /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${system_name}/conman.conf /etc/conman.conf
cp /var/www/ephemeral/prep/${system_name}/basecamp/* /var/www/ephemeral/configs/
systemctl restart dnsmasq
systemctl restart conman
systemctl start nexus
systemctl start basecamp
```

Start and configure NTP on the LiveCD for a fallback/recovery server:

```bash
pit:~ # /root/bin/configure-ntp.sh
```

## Manual Check 2 :: STOP :: Validate the Services

Now verify service health:
- dnsmasq, basecamp, and nexus should report HEALTHY and running.
- No podman container(s) should be dead.

```bash
csi pit validate --services
```

> - If basecamp is dead, restart it with `systemctl restart basecamp`.
> - If dnsmasq is dead, restart it with `systemctl restart dnsmasq`.
> - If nexus is dead, restart it with `systemctl restart nexus`.

You should see two containers: nexus and basecamp

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                         COMMAND               CREATED     STATUS         PORTS   NAMES
496a2ce806d8  dtr.dev.cray.com/metal/cloud-basecamp:latest                        4 days ago  Up 4 days ago          basecamp
6fcdf2bfb58f  docker.io/sonatype/nexus3:3.25.0              sh -c ${SONATYPE_...  4 days ago  Up 4 days ago          nexus
```

# Manual Check 3: Verify Outside Name Resolution

You should be able to resolve outside services like arti.dev.cray.com.

```bash
ping arti.dev.cray.com
```

Now you can start **Booting NCNs** [NCN Deploy](005-NCN-DEPLOY.md)
