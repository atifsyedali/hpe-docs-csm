      <description>CFS Sessions are Stuck in Pending State In rare cases it is possible that a CFS session can be stuck in a pending state. Sessions should only enter the pending state briefly, for no more than a few seconds while the corresponding Kubernetes job is being scheduled. If any sessions are in this state for more than a minute, they can safely be deleted. If the sessions were created automatically and retires are enabled, the sessions should be recreated automatically.</description>
